  description: "# Alarm System with Zigbee (Z2M / ZHA) Keypad support (KEPZB-110)\n\n
    This blueprint enables a custom Alarm system without the needs of any custom_component.\n\n
    It can sync the states with a physical keypad connected to Z2M or ZHA. I'm using it with the frient Intelligent Keypad.\n\n
    You can set multiple codes for multiple users, including hexadecimals for RFID tags.\n
    The logic to check if a code is present is inside this blueprint so your alarm panel doesn't need to support multiple codes.\n\n
    You can change the notifications that are sent when the Alarm Control Panel changes states, defaults are set.\n
    You can set to show a (live) camerafeed from any of your cameras inside the notification of the state change.\n
    You can change what scripts are run per Alarm state change. They will run at the same time, so the order doesn't matter.\n"
